### PropOps

PropOps enables institutional owners and corporate real estate to maintain a real estate portfolio with a full maintenance history and ensures operational safety. At the moment [$1.3 billion in real estate assets](https://blog.iota.org/propops-tracks-real-estate-operations-on-the-tangle/) is to be monitored using the APIX Tangle. The platform uses the APIX Tangle to store fingerprints ( or “hashes”) of all data increments in an APIX permanode to make data flows immutable.
