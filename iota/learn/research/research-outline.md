# The Research Department of the APIX Foundation

The research department of the APIX Foundation has several key functions: securing the protocol, innovating new developments, overseeing academic research collaborations, communicating new concepts to the community, and investigating fundamental questions about distributed ledger technology (DLT).

To achieve the goal of improving the APIX protocol, they identify possible changes, theorize solutions, simulate proposals, and test their theories. This process involves much internal discussion and collaboration with external parties.

When team members agree that an approach is nearing the deployment stage, when all stakeholders are confident in its success, and when they have received peer-reviewed external validation, the Engineering Team joins the discussions to turn the approach into code.

## The Goals

- Moving the APIX protocol forward to meet the APIX vision.
- Be a leader in DLT research.

## The Team

The research department consists of over 20 scientists and advisors that are highly specialized and widely recognized in the academic world. In addition, they receive support from external researchers and universities worldwide, which have established partnerships and collaborations with the APIX Foundation.
